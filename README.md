# Facial Emotion Recognition

## Motivation
Emotional intelligence is becoming increasingly essential in human-computer interactions. Systems that **detect and respond to user emotions** can enhance experiences in various domains, such as **mental health assessments, learning environments, and adaptive media systems**. 

This project aims to **expand emotion recognition** by creating a **real-time facial emotion detection system** using a webcam. Based on the identified emotion (e.g., **happy, sad, angry, surprised**), the system will trigger relevant actions, such as **playing music or displaying motivational content**.

##  Project Goals
- Implement **real-time** face & emotion detection using a webcam.
- Classify facial expressions using **pre-trained CNN models** (e.g., **FER-2013**).
- Trigger actions **based on emotions** (e.g., **play music or show motivational quotes**).
- Develop an **interactive display** using PyGame.

## 🛠 Project Approach
The project primarily leverages **Python** and the following technologies:
- **Face Detection & Webcam Input** → **OpenCV**
- **Emotion Classification** → CNN models with **TensorFlow/Keras** (e.g., **FER-2013**)
- **Additional Libraries** → Testing **DeepFace**, FaceRecognition for accuracy evaluation
- **Media Control Based on Emotion** → **PyGame** (to display motivational quotes or play music)
- **Real-Time Processing** → Optimized for **fast classification and response triggering**

## Technologies Used
-  **Python**
-  **OpenCV** (Face detection & webcam streaming)
-  **TensorFlow/Keras** (CNN model for emotion recognition)
-  **PyGame** (Interactive UI for triggered actions)
-  **DeepFace** (Accuracy testing & benchmarking)

##  Project Outcome
By the end of this project, we will achieve:
✔ **A functional real-time emotion recognition system**  
✔ **Webcam-based face detection & classification**  
✔ **Emotion-triggered media control (audio/text display)**  
✔ **Complete documentation & presentation**
